I received my Ph.D. in theoretical physics studying with [Daniel R. Phillips](https://github.com/DanielRPhillips) at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, USA. I am a member of the [BAND collaboration](https://github.com/bandframework) and [MUSES collaboration](https://musesframework.io) and I developed the Bayesian Model Mixing (BMM) package [Taweret](https://github.com/TaweretOrg/Taweret) with my fellow BAND and OSU collaborators. I work in the field of both creating and applying Bayesian Model Mixing methods to a wide variety of nuclear physics problems, especially the dense matter equation of state, performing crucial uncertainty quantification (UQ). My most recent BMM paper, in collaboration with members of the [BUQEYE collaboration](https://buqeye.github.io) on applying Bayesian model mixing to the nuclear matter equation of state can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06323). I am currently working to extend the BMM framework developed there to infer constraints on the macroscopic properties of neutron stars.

In September of 2025, I will be joining the STRONGINT group at Technische Universität Darmstadt in Germany as a Herzberg Fellow!

Some of my current and future research interests are:
- Bayesian Model Mixing/Uncertainty Quantification
- Equation of State (EOS) of dense matter/neutron stars
- Ab initio many-body methods
- Emulators for dense matter and nuclear structure
- Effective field theories (EFTs)
- Quantum Computing (and its application to nuclear physics and many-body methods)

Some of my close collaborators are:
- [Dick Furnstahl](https://github.com/furnstahl) (OSU)
- [Christian Drischler](https://github.com/cdrischler) (OU/FRIB)
- [Sudhanva Lalit](https://github.com/sudhanvalalit) (FRIB)

I'm a member of:
- [The Bayesian Analysis of Nuclear Dynamics (BAND) collaboration](https://bandframework.github.io)
- [The Modular Unified Solver of the Equation of State (MUSES) collaboration](https://musesframework.io)
- [The FRIB Theory Alliance](https://fribtheoryalliance.org)
- [The CompactObject team](https://chunhuangphy.github.io/CompactObject/)

Fun facts:
- I'm an avid fan of classic rock, especially Led Zeppelin, Electric Light Orchestra, the Moody Blues, the Beatles, the Doors, George Harrison's solo work, and David Bowie
- My favourite modern bands include Florence + the Machine, Hozier, and Grimes
- I love hiking among the hills of Athens and Appalachia, and camping in northern Michigan
- I am a lifelong reader and enjoyer of both contemporary fiction and classic novels, including those by Charlotte Brontë, Jane Austen, J. R. R. Tolkien, E. M. Forster, Herman Melville, Thomas Hardy, Arthur C. Clarke, and Frank Herbert; my all-time favourite novel is Jane Eyre
- I'm a Michigander by birth and lived there for 18 years before moving to Athens, Ohio for my studies
- I am known to my friends as an anglophile and love a great many things British
