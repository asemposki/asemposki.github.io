## Formal experience

* Fall 2020 (virtual): Teaching assistant for PHYS 2052 laboratory and recitation sesions.
  * Topics: Calculus-based physics (electricity, magnetism, circuits, optics) 

* Spring 2020 (in-person and then virtual starting in March 2020): Teaching assistant for PHYS 2051 laboratory and recitation sessions.
  * Topics: Calculus-based physics (Newton's laws, conservation laws, thermodynamics)

* Fall 2019: Teaching assistant for PHYS 2051 laboratory and LON-CAPA tutoring sessions.
  * Topics: Calculus-based physics (Newton's laws, conservation laws, thermodynamics)

## Informal experience

I initiated two informal lecture and discussion sessions while a graduate student at Ohio University, both of which are described in detail below.

* Summer 2024: Informal Lectures on Quantum Field Theory, Part II.
  * Topics covered: interacting scalar field theories, calculation of tree-level and one-loop Feynman diagrams, renormalization.
  * Description: Graduate students in nuclear theory at Ohio University met every couple of days for 1.5 hours throughout the summer to teach each other and discuss Quantum Field Theory and angular momentum topics. This required me to make lecture notes, lead the lecture/discussion sessions, pull/construct problems, and work with peers to help them learn each subject.

* Summer 2023: Informal Lectures on Quantum Field Theory, Part I.
  * Topics covered: Second quantization, free scalar fields, introduction to interacting scalar field theories.
  * Description: Graduate students in nuclear theory at Ohio University met twice a week for 1-1.5 hours throughout the summer to teach each other and discuss Quantum Field Theory and nuclear scattering topics. Along with peers, I constructed lecture notes and led sessions, assigned problems, and helped others understand the material.
